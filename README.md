This project is divided into two primary parts: The Single Page Application and the RESTful Web API. The RESTful Web API represented the primary research component of the project, however the Single Page Application also proved to be heavy with research. 

The project used to be hosted on Microsoft Azure, however the educational credits alloted have since expired so the project is currently not live at any location.
